Find GIFs of your favorite animals

## How do I generate GIFs?

It's easy! Click on a button to generate some cool GIFs of that animal. If you have a specific animal in mind, you can add a button for it using that handy dandy "Add an Animal" box on the right.

## How do I get the GIFs to move?

It's also easy! Hover over one of the GIFs to see it in action. Once you move your mouse away, it'll stop.

## Do I have to only look for animals?

No. If your heart so desires, you can actually search for any GIF you want. Enter your search term into the "Add an Animal" box, and a button for it will appear. I suppose "Add an Animal" won't make as much sense in this context, though. :(

## How is GIF pronounced?

It's pronounced "jif". [The man who invented them said so.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBtKxsuGvko) This is not up for debate.

# Programming notes
* Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery
* Attempted to build layout using CSS Grid instead of Flexbox
* Had users hover over a GIF to play it instead of clicking on it, although I also wrote working code for the click function (commented out in the app.js file)
* Additional feature: Users cannot add a button that already exists, and if they attempt to do so, an error message will display and the existing button will be highlighted
